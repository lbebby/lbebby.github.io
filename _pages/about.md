<!-- I am a second year PhD student in Biomathematics at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. I am currently working with Dr. Mohammad Farazmand on developing state estimation methods for biological systems. I am interested in using data-driven methods and state reconstruction methods to understand problems arising from climate change.

Prior to attending graduate school, I taught high school mathematics for three years. I recieved my B.A. in Mathematics and Environmental Studies from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachussetts.  -->
