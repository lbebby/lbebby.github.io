I am a PhD student in [Biomathematics](http://bma.math.ncsu.edu/) at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, North Carolina. I am advised by [Dr. Mohammad Farazmand](https://www.mfarazmand.com/home). I work on developing data-driven state estimation methods for environmental systems. 

Prior to attending graduate school, I taught high school mathematics for three years. I recieved my B.A. in Mathematics and Environmental Studies from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachussetts.
