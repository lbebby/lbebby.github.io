I am a second year Biomathematics PhD student at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. I work with Dr. Mohamamd Farazmand on developing state reconstruction methods for biological systems. 

Prior to attending graduate school, I taught high school mathematics for three years. I graduated from Williams College in Williamstown, Massachussets in 2020 with a B.A. in Mathematics and Environmental Studies.
