Beyond research, I am dedicated to serving with the community at NC State and beyond.

## Association for Women (AWM) in Math & SK Day

I currently serve as the treasurer for our [NCSU AWM student chapter](https://wp.math.ncsu.edu/awm/). We organize monthly lunches for members of the department. I also organize Sonia Kovalevsky (SK) Day, an outreach event with workshops to inspire an interest in mathematics and problem-solving for local students in grades 6-12.

I organize NC State portion of local modeling competition for undergraduate students, the [Intercollegiate Math Modeling Challenge](https://sites.duke.edu/im2c/)between NC State and several other institutions.
